Description: The geneObjects package implements several functions for handling various gene classes 
    as objects with several slots based on Ensembl. It provides a way to represent different gene types 
    (e.g., protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs) and manipulate them in a unified 
    framework. It also provides various functions to access and modify the data stored in these objects.
